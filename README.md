## Purpose:

The purpose of this code is to find when a list of solar system objects are observable from a given observatory on Earth in order to aid proposal writing.

It will create:
* A csv of the JPL Horizons call for all the objects across the semester
* A csv summary of the median value for each night (to do)
* A pdf of nightly elevation charts and summary tables for all objects visible (to do)
* A pdf with summary charts to show how the observability and target properties change over the course of the full semester (to do)

The documentation can be found at [pyObsFind documentation](https://pyobsfind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
