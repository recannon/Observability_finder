Welcome to pyObsFind's documentation!
=====================================


The purpose of this code is to find when a list of solar system objects are observable from a given observatory on Earth in order to aid proposal writing.

It will create:

- A csv of the JPL Horizons call for all the objects across the semester

- A csv summary of the median value for each night (to do)

- A pdf of nightly elevation charts and summary tables for all objects visible (to do)

- A pdf with summary charts to show how the observability and target properties change over the course of the full semester (to do)


Please read our Quick Start section to learn how to install and run this package.
